        <h2> Sustainability at Michigan College Thrifts </h2>

        <div class='sustainability'>

            <p id = 'one'> 
                At Michigan College Thrifts, we are committed to sustainability. We always want to provide the most transparecny to our consumer. 
                Listed below we have some insight into our commitment to transparecny and sustainability. 
            </p>

            <div class= "two">
            
                <h3> Where we source </h3>
            
                <p> 
                    Almost all of our clothing, shoes, and other products are sourced second-hand, either through resale online or second-hand 
                    consignment and thrift stores. Clothing that is altered or "DIY"'d is also thrifted and fabrics and supplies are from other 
                    second-hand clothing pieces or purchased wholesale. Through our process, we hope to give these pieces another chance and a second life to show that 
                    sustainable shopping can be trendy, affordable, and practical for the everyday consumer. 

                </p>

            </div>

            <div class= "three">
            <h3> Charity </h3>

            <p id = 'three'>
                With our commitment to sustainability, we donate a poriton of the proceeds to the non-profit One Tree planted. For every clothing item 
                purchased, a tree is planted. One tree planted is a 501(C)(3) non-profit organizatin focused on global reforestation. They make 
                this process simple by allowing anyone to plant trees. As an environmental charity they are dedicated to making it easier
                for individuals and businesses to give back to the environment, create a healthier climate, protect biodiversity and help reforestation
                efforts around the world. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class= "four">
            <h3> Continuing our commitment </h3>
            
            <p id = 'four'> 
                While we continue to expand, we hope to focus our attention on other ways we can implement sustainability into our company.
                As a way to reduce our emissions from shipping products to buyers, we've offered porch pick up and local delivery. We've also tried 
                to keep our scope local, focusing on Michigan Colleges in particular to reduce our emissions when we ship products out. 
                We hope to continue this focus while looking into sustainable packaging options, which is the next field we hope to tackle. 
            </p>
